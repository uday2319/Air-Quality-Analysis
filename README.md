 This project looks at air pollution using data collected from different places. I used Python tools like NumPy and Pandas to organize and clean the data. Then, with Matplotlib, I made easy-to-understand charts that show how the air quality changes over time. This helps us see when the air is dirty or clean and can help people make better choices to protect their health and the environment. Itâ€™s a simple way to understand air pollution and why it matters and also used PM2.5 and PM10 values of the year 2025 for data for the above project # Air-Quality-Analysis

FEATURE 1: The project identifies patterns and trends in air pollution levels over time, helping to pinpoint periods or locations with poor air quality. This insight can support better decision-making for health and environmental protection.

FEATURE 2: The project can detect spikes or unusual changes in pollution, alerting users to potential air quality hazards quickly. This helps raise awareness and encourages timely actions to reduce exposure.
